### Incorrect Predictions (Direct QA)

**Example 1:**
- Question: What are the treatments for Urinary Tract Infections ?
- Gold Answer: Because most UTIs are caused by bacteria, bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics are the usual treatment. The type of antibiotic and length of treatment depend on the patients history and the type of bacteria causing the infection. Bladder infections may eventually get better on their own. But antibiotics can make the symptoms go away much more quickly. People usually feel better within a day or two of starting antibiotics. Drinking lots of fluids and urinating often may also speed healing. If needed, pain-killers can relieve the pain of a UTI. A heating pad on the back or abdomen may also help.

##comycin or other antibiotics for long periods of time. people who are hospitalized, particularly when they receive antibiotic treatment for long periods of time. people with weakened immune systems such as patients in intensive care units, or in cancer or transplant wards. people who have undergone surgical procedures such as abdominal or chest surgery. people with medical devices that stay in for some time such as urinary catheters or central intravenous ( iv ) catheters. people who are colonized with vre. top of page what is the treatment for vre? people with colonized vre ( bacteria are present, but have no symptoms of an infection ) do not need treatment. most vre infections can be treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. laboratory testing of the vre can determine which antibiotics will work. for people who get vre infections in their bladder and have urinary catheters, removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed can also help get rid of the infection. top of page how is vre spread? vre is often passed from person to person by the contaminated hands of caregivers. vre can get onto a caregiver ' s hands after they have contact with other people with vre or after contact with contaminated surfaces. vre can also be spread directly to people after they touch surfaces that are contaminated with vre. vre is not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. top of page how can patients prevent the spread of vre? if a patient or someone in their household has vre, the following are some things they can do to prevent the spread of vre : keep their hands clean. always wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing food. clean their hands after contact with persons who have vre. wash with soap and water ( particularly when visibly soiled ) or use alcohol - based hand rubs.

- pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection that affects one or both kidneys. - pyelonephritis is caused by a bacterium or virus infecting the kidneys. though many bacteria and viruses can cause pyelonephritis, the bacterium escherichia coli is often the cause. bacteria and viruses can move to the kidneys from the bladder or can be carried through the bloodstream from other parts of the body. - symptoms of pyelonephritis can vary depending on a persons age and may include the following : - fever - vomiting - back, side, and groin pain - chills - nausea - frequent, painful urination - children younger than 2 years old may only have a high fever without symptoms related to the urinary tract. older people may not have any symptoms related to the urinary tract either ; instead, they may exhibit confusion, disordered speech, or hallucinations. - most people with pyelonephritis do not have complications if appropriately treated with bacteria - fighting medications called antibiotics. - - - eating, diet, and nutrition have not been shown to play a role in causing or preventing pyelonephritis.

**Example 2:**
- Question: What are the symptoms of Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome ?
- Gold Answer: What are the signs and symptoms of Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abdominal pain - Areflexia - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cachexia - Constipation - Death in early adulthood - Decreased activity of cytochrome C oxidase in muscle tissue - Distal amyotrophy - Distal muscle weakness - Distal sensory impairment - Gastrointestinal dysmotility - Gastroparesis - Hypointensity of cerebral white matter on MRI - Intermittent diarrhea - Lactic acidosis - Leukoencephalopathy - Malabsorption - Malnutrition - Mitochondrial myopathy - Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions - Progressive - Progressive external ophthalmoplegia - Ptosis - Ragged-red muscle fibers - Sensorineural hearing impairment - Subsarcolemmal accumulations of abnormally shaped mitochondria - Vomiting - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.

- Context: mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency is a rare condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy, particularly during periods without food ( fasting ). signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency may begin during infancy or later in life. features that occur during infancy include feeding difficulties, lack of energy ( lethargy ), low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ), weak muscle tone ( hypotonia ), and liver problems. infants with this disorder are also at high risk for serious heart problems, breathing difficulties, coma, and sudden death. signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency that may begin after infancy include hypotonia, muscle pain, a breakdown of muscle tissue, and a loss of sensation in the extremities ( peripheral neuropathy ). problems related to mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. this disorder is sometimes mistaken for reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. most cases of reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections.

what are the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial membrane protein - associated neurodegeneration? the human phenotype ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for mitochondrial membrane protein - associated neurodegeneration. if the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. you can use the medlineplus medical dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. signs and symptoms approximate number of patients ( when available ) abnormal lower motor neuron morphology - ataxia - autosomal recessive inheritance - babinski sign - delayed speech and language development - dementia - distal amyotrophy - distal muscle weakness - dysarthria - elevated serum creatine phosphokinase - emotional lability - gait disturbance - hyperreflexia - hyporeflexia - impulsivity - lewy bodies - neurodegeneration - optic atrophy - oromandibular dystonia - parkinsonism - pes cavus - phenotypic variability - progressive - progressive visual loss - scapular winging - spasticity - tremor - the human phenotype ontology ( hpo ) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. much of this information comes from orphanet, a european rare disease database. the frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. the frequency may also be listed as a fraction. the first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. for example, a frequency of 25 / 25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined.

mitochondrial myopathies are a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to the mitochondriasmall, energy - producing structures that serve as the cells ' " power plants. " nerve cells in the brain and muscles require a great deal of energy, and thus appear to be particularly damaged when mitochondrial dysfunction occurs. some of the more common mitochondrial myopathies include kearns - sayre syndrome, myoclonus epilepsy with ragged - red fibers, and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke - like episodes. the symptoms of mitochondrial myopathies include muscle weakness or exercise intolerance, heart failure or rhythm disturbances, dementia, movement disorders, stroke - like episodes, deafness, blindness, droopy eyelids, limited mobility of the eyes, vomiting, and seizures. the prognosis for these disorders ranges in severity from progressive weakness to death. most mitochondrial myopathies occur before the age of 20, and often begin with exercise intolerance or muscle weakness. during physical activity, muscles may become easily fatigued or weak. muscle cramping is rare, but may occur. nausea, headache, and breathlessness are also associated with these disorders.
