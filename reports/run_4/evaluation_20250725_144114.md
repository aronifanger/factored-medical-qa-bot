### Incorrect Predictions (Direct QA)

**Example 1:**
- Question: What is (are) Irritable Bowel Syndrome ?
- Gold Answer: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a problem that affects the large intestine. It can cause abdominal cramping, bloating, and a change in bowel habits. Some people with the disorder have constipation. Some have diarrhea. Others go back and forth between the two. Although IBS can cause a great deal of discomfort, it does not harm the intestines.    IBS is common. It affects about twice as many women as men and is most often found in people younger than 45 years. No one knows the exact cause of IBS. There is no specific test for it. Your doctor may run tests to be sure you don't have other diseases. These tests may include stool sampling tests, blood tests, and x-rays. Your doctor may also do a test called a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. Most people diagnosed with IBS can control their symptoms with diet, stress management, probiotics, and medicine.

- Context: irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal ( gi ) disorder, meaning it is a problem caused by changes in how the gi tract works. children with a functional gi disorder have frequent symptoms, but the gi tract does not become damaged. ibs is not a disease ; it is a group of symptoms that occur together. the most common symptoms of ibs are abdominal pain or discomfort, often reported as cramping, along with diarrhea, constipation, or both. in the past, ibs was called colitis, mucous colitis, spastic colon, nervous colon, and spastic bowel. the name was changed to reflect the understanding that the disorder has both physical and mental causes and is not a product of a persons imagination. ibs is diagnosed when a child who is growing as expected has abdominal pain or discomfort once per week for at least 2 months without other disease or injury that could explain the pain. the pain or discomfort of ibs may occur with a change in stool frequency or consistency or may be relieved by a bowel movement. - - - the gi tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. the movement of muscles in the gi tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes, allows for the digestion of food. organs that make up the gi tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestinewhich includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectumand anus. the intestines are sometimes called the bowel. the last part of the gi tractcalled the lower gi tractconsists of the large intestine and anus. the large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from partially digested food passed from the small intestine. the large intestine then changes waste from liquid to a solid matter called stool.
