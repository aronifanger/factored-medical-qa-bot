## Example Predictions

### Correct Predictions (Direct QA)

**Example 1:**
- Question: How many people are affected by cystinuria ?
- Gold Answer: Cystinuria affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people.
- Predicted: Cystinuria affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people.
- Confidence: 1.000
- Context: Cystinuria affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people.

**Example 2:**
- Question: What are the treatments for Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease ?
- Gold Answer: How might Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease be treated?
- Predicted: How might Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease be treated?
- Confidence: 0.000
- Context: How might Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease be treated? These resources address the diagnosis or management of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: PLP1-Related Disorders  - Genetic T...

### Incorrect Predictions (Direct QA)

**Example 1:**
- Question: Is Galactosialidosis inherited ?
- Gold Answer: How is galactosialidosis inherited? Galactosialidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.
- Predicted: How is galactosialidosis inherited?
- Confidence: 0.001
- F1 Score: 0.16
- Context: How is galactosialidosis inherited? Galactosialidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with...

**Example 2:**
- Question: What are the treatments for Sjgren's Syndrome ?
- Gold Answer: There is no known cure for Sjgren's syndrome nor is there a specific treatment to restore gland secretion. Treatment is generally symptomatic and supportive. Moisture replacement therapies may ease the symptoms of dryness. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used to treat musculoskeletal symptoms. For individuals with severe complications, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs may be prescribed.
