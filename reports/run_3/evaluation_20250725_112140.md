## Example Predictions

### Incorrect Predictions (Direct QA)

**Example 1:**
- Question: What is (are) Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) ?
- Gold Answer: Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. The disorder, which is sometimes called chronic relapsing polyneuropathy, is caused by damage to the myelin sheath (the fatty covering that wraps around and protects nerve fibers) of the peripheral nerves. Although it can occur at any age and in both genders, CIDP is more common in young adults, and in men more so than women. It often presents with symptoms that include tingling or numbness (beginning in the toes and fingers), weakness of the arms and legs, loss of deep tendon reflexes (areflexia), fatigue, and abnormal sensations. CIDP is closely related to Guillain-Barre syndrome and it is considered the chronic counterpart of that acute disease.

**Example 2:**
- Question: What is (are) Chromosome 8q24.3 deletion syndrome ?
- Gold Answer: Chromosome 8q24.3 deletion syndrome is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on chromosome 8 at a location designated q24.3. The signs and symptoms vary but may include slow growth, developmental delay, characteristic facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Some affected people may also have coloboma, kidney abnormalities, and heart defects. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.
